# Finch
C++ Framework

Finch is a C++ framework that I am building. It is mostly a project I have for learning C++ so it is not intended for actual use in any large-scale projects.
Feel free to use any of the code I write to your liking, but keep in mind that I cannot guarantee quality code or even functional code.
